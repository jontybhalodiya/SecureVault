<h1>Project Description:</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Secure Vault Application is a Java-based project designed to provide a secure platform for users to store and manage their sensitive data, such as website credentials, in a secure manner. This project incorporates various security features, including data encryption using RSA, user authentication, and database integration. The application ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the stored information by using strong encryption techniques.

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
The Secure Vault Application is a desktop application that offers the following key features:

<h2>User Authentication:</h2> Users can log in to the application using a username and password. This ensures that only authorized users can access their secure vault.

<h2>RSA Encryption:</h2> The application utilizes RSA encryption to securely store and retrieve sensitive data, such as website URLs, usernames, and passwords. RSA is a strong asymmetric encryption algorithm, ensuring the confidentiality of the stored data.

<h2>User Registration:</h2> New users can register in the application, creating their accounts with a unique username and password.

<h2>Database Integration:</h2> The project integrates with a MySQL database to store user information and encrypted data securely.

<h2>Add Content:</h2> Users can add new content to their vault, which includes website URLs, usernames, and passwords. The entered data is securely encrypted with their RSA public key before being stored in the database.

<h2>View Stored Details:</h2> Users can view the details stored in their vault, and the application will decrypt and display this information using their private RSA key.

<h2>Logout:</h2> Users can log out from their vault, ensuring their data remains secure when they are not using the application.

<h1>Technical Details</h1>
The project is implemented using Java and utilizes various libraries and technologies. Here are some technical details:

<h2>Encryption</h2>
AES Encryption: The project uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to generate a secret key that is used to encrypt and decrypt data within the application. This ensures the confidentiality and security of the data stored in the vault.

RSA Encryption: RSA encryption is employed to secure the storage and retrieval of user data. RSA is used for the encryption and decryption of website URLs, usernames, and passwords. The user's public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption.

<h2>Database</h2>
MySQL Database: The project integrates with a MySQL database to securely store user information, such as usernames, passwords, and RSA key pairs. It also stores the encrypted website credentials.

User Authentication: The application verifies user credentials against the database when users log in. The database maintains user-specific data, including the user's public and private RSA keys.

<h2>User Interface</h2>
Swing: The project utilizes Java Swing for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). Users interact with the application through a simple, user-friendly interface.

JOptionPane: JOptionPane dialogs are used to display messages and alerts to the user, such as login status and error messages.

<h2>Key Management</h2>
Key Pair Generation: When a user registers, the application generates an RSA key pair (public and private keys) for them. These keys are used for data encryption and decryption.

Key Serialization: Public and private keys are serialized into strings and stored securely in the database.

<h2>Error Handling</h2>
Exception Handling: The project includes exception handling to ensure that errors are gracefully handled. Users are informed about any issues through alert dialogs.
<h1>Project Flow</h1>
Here's how the application works:

<h2>Initialization:</h2> The project starts by generating a secret key using AES for data encryption. It also establishes a connection with the MySQL database.

<h2>User Authentication:</h2>

Users can log in with their username and password.
The application checks the user's credentials against the database.
If the login is successful, the user's public and private RSA keys are retrieved from the database.
<h2>User Registration:</h2>

New users can register with a unique username and password.
The project generates an RSA key pair for the user.
The user's public and private keys are stored securely in the database.
<h2>Vault UI:</h2>

After successful login, the user is presented with a vault UI.
They can add website credentials to the vault.
The application encrypts this data using the user's RSA public key before storing it in the database.
<h2>View Stored Details:</h2>

Users can view their stored website credentials.
The application decrypts the data using the user's private RSA key for display.
<h2>Logout:</h2>

Users can log out to secure their data.
<h2>Error Handling:</h2>

The application includes error handling to manage any issues related to data encryption, decryption, database operations, and more.
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
The Secure Vault Application provides a secure and user-friendly solution for managing sensitive data. By incorporating RSA encryption, user authentication, and database integration, it ensures the confidentiality and integrity of stored information.
